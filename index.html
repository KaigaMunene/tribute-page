            Mugo was a hardworking, down to earth kind of person. He was a football fan like many of us and every free chance he got he would go and play the game he loved with his friends.
            He was always happy everytime I met him and he was always there with grandma, either chating with her or doing various chores in grandma's homestead.
            I for one am a man of few words, we never talked a lot with Mugo but he would always listen to me and find ways to engage me in a certain conversation.
            It's truly a blessing to have had him mine and yourlives, I don't know what plans God had for taking him so early but i Know he up there in heaven paving a way for all of us.For one I know he safe up there with grandpa smiling down on us.
            I will miss you cousin, I don't have much to say but this is a poem for you:
            <h2 id="headline">Dear Cousin,</h2>
            <p>
                Even though you are gone away,<br>
                Your love will always be here to stay.<br>
                You touched our hearts with so many things.
            </p>

            <p>
                God knew you were the one to save,<br>
                He took you home to get some rest,<br>
                Even though we loved you best.
            </p>

            <p>
                Our hearts are filled with so much pain,<br>
                God loved you more, there was no shame.<br>
            </p>
            <p>
                At this time we must let go.<br>
                Your memories we will keep a flow.<br>
                Rest our dear cousin with peace of mind,<br>
                Your memories will live on through.<br>
            </p>
            <p>To my dear cousin,<br>
                Mugo.
